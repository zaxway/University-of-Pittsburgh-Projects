Project 2
What I have done and implemented in this project?
I have made the entire ALU and covered all of the instructions ranging from halt all the way down to jr. I have also made the 4 branches.
What I have not done in this project?
I have made parts to the jal, but haven’t fully tested to see if it works, so it may or not work. I have not connected the branches to anything yet because I am currently running out of time. For the same reason I have not connected Jr to anything at all yet, but you can check it out for yourself and I am sure that I have implemented them the right way… just need to connect it haha. 

I did not implement the extra credit.
