 * 0 or 1 after the maze is generated by the genMaze() function.
 * If the north component is 0, it means that there is no wall
 * in the north direction of that cell. If the north component is
 * 1, there is a wall in the north direction. Meaning are the same
 * for east, south, and west components.
